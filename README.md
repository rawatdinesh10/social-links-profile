## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Meta viewport Tag
- CSS Grid (After modification with Flexbox)
- Google fonts
-

### What I learned

I learned about CSS Grid layout And completed the challenge by it (After modification with Flexbox). I learned a lot of properties of CSS Grid and their usage. I also learned about Meta viewport tag and how it helps to build the responsive web pages. I also learned a bit about media queries but didn't use in this challenge because I'm still not confident about it but will surely use in future challenges.

THere is the code snoppet I want to highlight which I learned during this challenge.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
(learned about viewport and its directives or properties by Apple)
```

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  font-family: Inter, sans-sarif;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}

.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  width: 19em;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would continue doing challenges with CSS Grid. I need to learn media queries, Bootstrap and React to be more confident building projects. In my nect challenges, I will use Bootstrap and Media queries to make responsive web design so first I''ll learn about these and then do the challenges.

### Useful resources

- [https://css-tricks.com] - This helped me for CSS Grid. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
- https://[developer.mozilla.org] - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand CSS Grid and other HTML, CSS topics. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
